=======

This repository is used to define formats for feed data and the realtime API for intu.co.uk.

In order for products to be displayed on the intu.co.uk at least one product and one inventory feed 
needs to be provided and either uploaded to the intu.co.uk secure server or made available in an agreed location.
If order integration is not automated orders should be manually fulfilled using our web based interface. Details 
can be provided on request

* Product feeds should be updated at least every 24 hours.
* Inventory feeds should be updated at least every 15 minutes.
* The order api enables live access to orders placed on intu.co.uk and allows products and inventory to be managed in realtime
